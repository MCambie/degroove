- **The app** : 

## Client needs : 
- We allow every employee to spend 2h/month to give his skills to others
- Employees have specific skills ex: accountability, HR, management, finance, IT
- The foundation selects projects that could benefit from those skills
- The projects receive time and skills from our employees to become stronger     

## Specifications : 
- A personal account where you can enter the skills you want to share and personal details (country, region, age)
ex: Silvia Steisel, based Brussels, skills: communication, HR, French, Dutch, English​

- A list of projects with missions that need skills you have
ex: Becode needs HR trainers

- Apply to a project that sends an automated email to the project + foundation with his profile details
An inbox or alert system that tells you if you have the mission

- A dashboard to manage your mission: puts the date in your outlook agenda, an automated counter tells you how much time you have spend
You can rate the project 

## Our response: 
We created the app in React-Native, with 2 toolkit : react-native-elements and react-native-base.
Guillaume and Thibault were in charge of the BackEnd (rooter, building, compilation, fonctions...)
Géraldine and Marie were in charge of the FrontEnd (pages creations, design...)

## Our difficulties :
- Coding in a very new language, we only had one day to get familiar with react-native before the challenge.
- The time was dinitely our ennemy, we made this app in only 3 days and half.
